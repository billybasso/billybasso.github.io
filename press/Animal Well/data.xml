  <description>Animal Well is a video game about exploring a forsaken labyrinth and unravelling its secrets. Youâ€™ll collect items, solve puzzles, and try to survive what lurks in the dark.</description>

  <history>
    I've been spending the last 10 years working as an engineer at various game studios, and during the past four, Animal Well has been percolating in the background. I wanted to see if I could take gameplay mechanics from survival horror games and apply them to something with a less severe art style. I also wanted to create a game that is not dependent on updates or the internet, but is instead pre-loaded with secrets that may take years to uncover. Like a forgotten artifact, lost in time. I ended up making the engine from scratch so I could have complete control over everything that went into the shipped binary. It will be my first independent release.</history>
